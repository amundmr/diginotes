For two persons:
- 4 medium potatoes

- spice for potato chips
- 375g deboned and skin free cod
*cod fryer coating*
- 120g wheat flour
- 0.5 teaspoons salt

- 1.3 dL water
*Tartar sauce*
- 1 eggyolk
- 0.5 teaspoons lemonjuice
- 0.5 teaspoons dijon mustard
- 0.5 cloves of garlic
- 1 dL oil (I tried olive, it was bad. Try something tasteless)
- 1.5 pickles
- 1.5 tbs capers
- salt

## How to

Start by preparing the potato, the rest can be done while the potato is beeing baked/fried.


### Potatoes

1. Peel all the potatoes
2. Cut to sticks
3. Add to a plastic bag, and add some olive oil and cips spice (I used "grillkrydder"). Then fondle the bag to make sure that it is spread evenly
4. Put a baking paper in a large oven pan and make the potatoes span the entire pan.
5. Bake at 200$^\circ$C until it looks good.


### Cod fryer coating batter

This is supposed to rest in the fridge for 20min when done, so do this now, and then make the tartar sauce

1. Mix wheat flour, salt, baking soda, and add cold water
2. Mix until smooth and put to rest in the fridge.


### Tartar sauce

1. Mix eggyolk with lemon juice, dijon mustard and pressed garlic.
2. while mixing violently, slowly add all the oil.
3. Chop up and add the pickles and capers. Add salt to your liking


### Cod frying

If you want to make an oilbath, be my guest. I just use a lot of butter in a pan.
1. Add a lot (maybe start with 50g) butter to a frying pan, and put the heat up high
2. Cut up the cod in sticks sized to your liking. Do any eventual deboning or deskinning. The pieces should ideally be less than 2 cm thick in order to be properly cooked.
3. When hot (Butter starts to brown), Coat the cod in the batter and put it in the pan.
4. Let it fry on one side until brown before you flip it.
5. Do this to all the cod pieces

When this is done, the potatoes should soon be ready. Serve with the tartarsauce and some ketchup.

Note to self: The tartarsauce was horrible, but Maria liked it very much.
