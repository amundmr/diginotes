# Welcome
This is a collection of notes taken with the markdown-based noting software [[Obsidian]]. I will as an experiment continue building this network of notes based on many things in my life. Cooking, hobby projects, philosophical thoughts, outdoors stuff and [[studies]] is just some of the topics I touch upon in my notes.

Don't have a place to start? 
[[Cooking]]
[[Hikes]]
[[Maintenance]]
[[Hobbies]]
