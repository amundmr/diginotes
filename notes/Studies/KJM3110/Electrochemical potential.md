- Gibbs energy: $$
\bar{G}_{i}=\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial n_{i}}\right)_{T, P, s \neq i}=\quad \widetilde{\mu}_{i}=\mu_{i}+z_{i} F \varphi \quad=\mu_{i}^{0}+R T \ln a_{i}+z_{i} F \varphi
$$
- In a chemical system in equil, all chem pots are constant
- In a chemical reaction at equil, the chem pots of reactants and products are equal.
- In an electrochemical system in equil, all electrochemical potentials are constant
- In an electrochemical reaction at equil, the electrochemical potentials of reactants and products are equal.
