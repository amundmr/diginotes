# Electrical charge
- Physical property of matter 
- Equal charge repels
- Opposite charge attracts
- Quantized in elemental charge $e$.
- 1$e$ = $1.602\times10^{-19}$
- Symbol of charge: q, unit: C (Coulomb)
- Electron charge: -$e$, proton: $e$, Neutron: 0
- Force between charges: $F = -\frac{k_e q_1 q_1}{r^2} = -\frac{q_1 q_2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r^2}$
- $k_e$ = electrical constant, which for vacuum =$\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0}$
- $\epsilon_0$ = dielectric constant (tabular value)
- Net charge seeks to external boundaries(surfaces, interfaces)
- Interior(bulk) phases remain electronneutral
- *Electroneutrality:* Sum of negative and positive charges balance (cancel) each other

## Electrical field
- $X = \frac{F}{Q_{test}}$
- Spherical field - inverse square law
- $F = -\frac{q_1 q_2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r^2}$, $X = \frac{q_1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r^2}$
- Fields run from positive to negative (arrows of field towards negative) and shows in what direction a positive charge feels the force.
- **Planar field**
- Charge density of plates $q$(C/m$^2$)
- Force is independent of distance ($l$)
- Total field strength: $X = \frac{q}{\epsilon}$

## Electrical work
- Work is force times distance
- W = $F\times[-\delta R] = -QX\delta r$
- Travel $\delta r$ is there negative and the work we do is positive.
- **Electric Potential**
	- Difference in potential between two sites (constant field):
	- $U = \phi_B - \phi_A = \frac{W_{A->B}}{Q} = -X\delta r$
	- 1V = 1J/C (one unit work per unit charge)
	- Potential over variable field(Spherical symmetry):
	- ![[Pasted image 20210112132625.png]]
- *Poisson equation* explains how potential varies in space from a net charge.
	- Planar case: areal charge densities $q_0$ and $q_L$
	- $\frac{d^2\phi}{dx^2} = \frac{-\rho(x)}{\epsilon}$

## Conductance and capacitance
- Conductors: long range transport
- Dielectrics(capacitance) only short range transport
	- Insulators
- Conductors
	- Electronic conductords
		- Metals, semiconds(CB electrons, VB holes)
	- Ionic conductors
		- Anionic, cationic
		- Crystalline: Defects, vacancy, interstitial, intercalation??

- Capacitance:
- Stored charge $Q = \frac{-A\epsilon}{L}\Delta E
- Capacitance $C = \frac{-Q}{\Delta E} = \frac{\epsilon A}{L}
	- Unit: F = C/V
	- $\epsilon = \epsilon_r \epsilon_0$ Relative*vacuum permitivity.
- Current:
- I = Q/t, 1A = 1C/s
- Current density: i (A/m$^2$) = I/A (current devided by arial)

- Conductivity $\sigma$ or $\kappa$ (S/m)=i/X (Ohms Lov)
- Conductance G
- Resistitivity $\rho$(ohm m)
- Resistance R (ohm)

## Mobility
- Mechanical mobility B expresses how easy it is to move a species of drift velocity $v$ by a force F
	- $v = BF$
- Current density is obtained by multiplication with concentration and charge
	- $i = zecv = zecBF$ (z = # charges, e = elem charge)
- Charge mobility (or just mobility) is defined as $u = zeB$
	- i = zecBF = ucF
- In electrical field: F = zeX
	- i = ucF=zeucX
- *Conductivity is charge times charge mobility time concentration*: $\sigma = zeuc$
- $i = \sigma X$ (Ohms law)
