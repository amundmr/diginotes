# Biomaterials
Produced by living orgnisms
- bones, teeth, spines, shells

## Categories
- Biomimicing
- Biocompatible
	- Ti-implant
- Bioinert
	- SiO$_2$
	- Stainless steel
- Bioactive
	- Apatite

Last three are just materials interacting with biologicals, but biomimicing try to replicate biocreations

## Biomineralization
The mechanism by which biological creatures create inorganic solids.
Differences between "natural" and man-made analouges:
- Exceptional control over shape, zise and orientation
- Not formed corresponding to thermodynamic or kinetic control (as abiogenic materials is)
- Extreme control over local environments (e.g. chemical composition)

### Controlled crystal growth
- Nucleation and growth in supramolecular confined host may result in size limitations, but would NOT control morphology.
- Morphology can be controlled by strict control of localized chemical environment. (Ex specific surface-attaching surfactants limiting growth?)
- Spatial localization of ion pumps in the compartment may shape growing crystal by turning on and off ion flows.

### Used for
- Mechanical properties (hardness, strength)
- Chemical storage(Calcium storage)
- Navigation

**Examples:**
- Velcro: Biomimetic. From burrs that stuck on dog hair.
- Shark skin: Rough enough to be used as sandpaper, same material as shark teeth. Reduces water friction.
- Calcium dominates due to low solubility.
- Calcium Carbonate: CaCO$_3$, Calcite, arganite, vaterite: Exoskeletons, eggshells, corals, mollucs
- Calcium phosphates: Endoskeletons (bones, teeth), calcium storage.
- Calcium oxalate: Calcium storage, passive deposits in plants, calculi for excretory tracts.
- Metal sulfates: Gravity sensors, exoskeletons, 
- Amorphous silica: defense in plants, diatom valves, sponge spicules, radiolarian tests.
- Iron oxides: chiton teeth, magnetic sensors(compass needles in bacterias).
- In the sea:
	- Diatoms: SiO$_2$
	- Alges: CaCO$_3$


## How diatoms create silicon dioxide
- Diatoms are:
	- Complex shape
	- Grown in cell structures
- SiO$_4^{2-}$ fed into cell by ion pumps, and stabilized by a cofactor in the cell.
- Then it is precipitated through specific openings, like lithography.

## How proteins is used to guide certain types of calcium carbonates
- Templating: Proteins with charge groups corresponding to crystal structure of CaCO$_3$.
- Ex: "Biological epitaxy": Collagen used to nucleate bone crystals.

## Biomimetic materials chemistry
- Difficult to mimic, extreme complexity not precedented by man.
- Examples:
	- Microemulsion, Phospholipid vesicles, proteins
	- Reverse micells formed by surfactant-water molecules producing nanoparticles where oxides can grow

## Virus to make batteries:
- Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) as anode material
- TMV binds to metal electrode, thin film deposited on top for current collecting and then active material
- Gives big surface -> high C-rates
- But TMV becomes inert..
