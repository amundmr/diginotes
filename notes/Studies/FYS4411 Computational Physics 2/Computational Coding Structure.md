# Structure
How to structure a programme (for easier resue, ex in project2):
- Classes: System and Solver
	- System: 
		- Wave functions
		- Hamiltonian
		- Local energy(E$_L$)
			- Project 1: if possible compute analytical expression for E$_L$ (Local energy)
				- $E_L (\vec{k}_i \vec{\alpha}) = \frac{1}{\psi_E..}...$
	- Solver: 
		- Metropolis sampling (Project 1 & 2)
		- Neural networks
		- Gradient descent method
		- Coupled cluster
		- Other many body methods
