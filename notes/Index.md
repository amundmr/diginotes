# Welcome
This is a collection of notes taken with any text editor, ran through [neuron zettelkasten](https://neuron.zettel.page/) in order to generate a html website. I will as an experiment continue building this network of notes based on many things in my life. Cooking, hobby projects, philosophical thoughts, outdoors stuff and [[studies]] is just some of the topics I touch upon in my notes.

Don't have a place to start? 
[[Cooking]]
[[Hikes]]
[[Maintenance]]
[[Hobbies]]

# History
This vault was originally started with the [[Obsidian]] software, however when neuron came out, i quickly switched in order to not have to maintain a custom .
