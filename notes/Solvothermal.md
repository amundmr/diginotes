# Solvothermal
The big thing here is beeing able to dissolve various compounds which are not dissolvable at regular conditions.
- H$_2$O, T\>100$^\circ$C
- Other solvents: NH$_3$, HF, HBr, Cl$_2$, HCl, CO$_2$, SO$_4$, H$_2$S, CS$_2$, C$_2$H$_5$OH +++
- NH$_4$ is common (Ammonothermal)
- Hydrothermal:
	- Crystallization of large crystals
	- Synthesis of e.g. oxide powders (ex: Zeolites)
	- Leaching e.g. treatment of ores
- Started 1845
	- Important for big crystals of quartz
		- Grown by the kilotonne in 1900
		- Used for electronics, watches(oscillators), optical properties, laser windows, prisms
	- Other important crystals: ZnO2, Emerald, Calcite

## Technical
- Usually more material dissolves at higher T
- H$_2$O with higher T:
	- Ion product increases
	- Viscosity decreases
	- Polarity (dielectric constant) decreases (but increases with pressure)
- Synthesis usually in closed vessels
	- T-P-V considerations are CRUCIAL

Two main synthesis types:
- Isothermal: powder synthesis
- T-gradient: for larger crystals

### Sub vs Supercritical
- Closed autoclave -> autogeneous pressure
- H$_2$O above these conds is supercritical T: 374.15$^\circ$C, P = 220bar.

### Autoclave filling
- 32% filling -> H$_2$O fills autoclave at T$_c$.
	- Higher filling results in full autoclave at lower T, and pressure increase.
	- ex: 80% filling at 245$^\cric$C -> autoclave explosion

### Mineralizers
- Used to increase crystallization rates
- Usually F$^-$ or OH$^-$ (alkali metal hydroxides, chlorides..)
- Quartz synthesis at T-gradient 400-380$^\circ$C at 1kbar
	- Solubility too low at these temps, NaOH(or others) can be added

### Retrograde solubility
- When solubility decrease at higher T.
- Can be due to properties change in solvent or compound
- Ex: SiO$_2$ decrease in solubility over 350$^\circ$C as long as below 700bar.
	- Also seen for halides, calcium carbonate ..

### Hydrothermal
**Advantages:**
- Moderate T (100-300$^\circ$C) subcritically at autogeneous pressures.
- Possible to synthesise materials below transformation temperatures ($\alpha$-CuI @ 390$^\circ$C, $\alpha-\beta$ transition for Quartz @ 580$^\circ$C)
- Transition metals can be made with unusual ox-states (CrO$_2$)
- Prep of metastable phases (GeO$_2$ with Quarts structure using Quarts seed)
- Formation of Zeolites + other microporous materials
- Usually dissolution/[[precipitation]] mechanisms

**Leaching:**
- Bayer process -> extract high-grade Al(OH)$_3$ from bauxite ore
	- Hydrothermal extraction w/dense NaOH solution via reaction to soluble aluminate complex(NaAl(OH)$_4$)
	- Al(OH)$_3$ precipitated by cooling, diluting and seeding
	- Heated to corundum for Al metal production.

### Eh-Ph diagrams
- Ox state can be controlled by pH and V.
- Diagrams change with T and P
	- Lines pushed down and left at higher T

**Buffers:**
Used to control the potential to ensure spesific ox-states. Hydrogen permeable membranes can be used. CuO can buffer to ensure Fe$^{2+}$ is not made.

## Setups
### Synthesis in T-gradient
- Nutrient (polycrystalline powder of precursor) placed in bottom
- Baffle (perforated disc) separates dissolution and growth zones and reduces particle flow
- T$_1$\< T$_2$ -> convection to transport hot L to GrowthZone.
- Required: some wt% solubility 0.001-0.1wt% sol diff over 10

### Autoclaves
- Open and closed vessels
- *Morey*: Closed, up to 400$^\circ$C, 400 bar, simple, autogeneous
- *Tuttle*: "Cold seal" outside oven, may be watercooled. Pressure from external source, up to 1100$^\circ$C, 5000bar.
