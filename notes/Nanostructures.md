# Nanostructures
- Properties depend on chemistry and arrangement of building blocks in 3D
- Size matters! Metals conduct, not NP metals.
	- Bonds->orbitals: Particle in box
	- Surface/interface effects: High % of atoms are on surface (5nm=50%surface atoms)
- Nanocrystalline
	- Grains in nanosize: (ex: NP Pt 400% more catalytic)
	- Network of intercrystalline regions
	- Nanocomposites: NP's in matrix
		- Metal-NP's composites as heterogenes catalyst
		- Semiconductor (Q-dots)
		- Nanofibres in ceramic matrices
		- Ex: Damascus sabre: CNT NP's

## Nanocrystalline ceramics
Regular ceramics typically 10$\mu$m grains.
Nano:
- 10-100nm grains
- 3nm grains -> 75% in interphase
- Interphase density only 60-70% of bulk
- Not equilibrium state
- Used as catalyst of oxides

### Diffusion/Sintering
Densifiable by sintering at lower temps.
- High surface energy
- Short diffusion lengths
- Low stability of interphase region
Doped more efficiently at low T

### Hardness/Strength
- Are higher for NP's than regular.
- Superplasticity: Can undergo deformation without fracture. 
	- Not yet proven for low Temp
	- Can become ductile.

## Gold/Silver NP's
### Melting
Happens at lower T with smaller NP size.

### Au-catalyst
- Makes CO$_2$ of CO. 
- NP \> 10nm -> no effect
- \< 5nm, hemispherical -> effective
- \< 2nm, dependent on atom amount
	- Cubo-octahedron: Low activity
	- Icosahedron: High activity
