# Audi A4 B5 1.8 Motor oil change
## Parts:
- 4L 5W-30 Oil (Motor only needs 3.5L)
- Oil filter (50-652 art. nr. biltema)
- Drain plug crush washer (M14x1,5 for me, some have M26..)

## Procedure
- Remove belly splash cover. Flat head screws: 3 in the front, 3 in the back, two in each wheel well.
- Open drain plug and let drain.

- Remove oil filter. If you have good access underneath the car, it can be reached from there. Alternatively you can loosen the coolant reservoir and reach down there(but it is much less space to work with). Prime new with oil (+ oil rubber seal) and screw as tight as you can with your hands.

- Replace drain plug crush washer and install plug 40Nm(30ft-lb)
- Fill about 3L oil.
- Procedure for oil check:
	- Heat engine, shut off on level ground, wait 3 min, then check dipstick (as per workshop manual)
- Top of hash marking is perfect
	- if too low, add more. 
	- Between the bends on the dipstick it is around 1L oil. 
	- Be careful, level above hash mark is dangerous!
