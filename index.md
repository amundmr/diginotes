# Welcome
This is a collection of notes taken with any text editor, ran through [neuron zettelkasten](https://neuron.zettel.page/) in order to generate a html website. I will as an experiment continue building this network of notes based on many things in my life. Cooking, hobby projects, philosophical thoughts, outdoors stuff and studies is just some of the topics I touch upon in my notes.

Don't have a place to start?

# History
This vault was originally started with the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) software, however when neuron came out, i switched in order to not have to maintain a custom program for converting to HTML.
