# Diginotes
Welcome! You've reached the github repo of my personal note-taking system!

Notes are taken with [Obsidian](obsidian.md), which offers a great interface with bidirectional linking within markdown files. This software was suggested to me by my good friend [kmaasrud](https://github.com/kmaasrud), and I will be basing my html-frontend on his [obsidian-html](https://github.com/kmaasrud/obsidian-html) script.
The html files will be hosted on github pages, and can thus be found in the gh-pages branch of this repo.
