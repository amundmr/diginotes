# Diginotes
Welcome! You've reached the github repo of my personal note-taking system!

Notes are taken in VScode using the [svsool.markdown-memo](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svsool.markdown-memo) plugin and the [paste-image](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mushan.vscode-paste-image) plugin. It is then converted to HTML using [neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/) with a GitHub actions workflow.

First, notes were taken with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which offers a great interface with bidirectional linking within markdown files. This software was suggested to me by my good friend [kmaasrud](https://github.com/kmaasrud), and my html-frontend was generated by his [oboe](https://github.com/kmaasrud/oboe) script.
