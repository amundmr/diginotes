- The XRD patterns show that impurity(LiAlO2) arises when $2x \geq 0.6$.
- The FTIR and Raman spectra indicate that the introduction of Al in the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 increases the disordering degree of Ni/Mn ions, changing the spinel structure from P4332 to Fd3¯m.
- Cyclic voltammetry tests show that the voltage step between Ni2+/Ni3+ and Ni3+/Ni4+ have a sudden leap at 2x = 0.075, responding to the structural difference of the spinels.
- At room temperature the LiNi0.45Al0.10Mn1.45O4 presents the best cycle performance with the capacity retention of 95.4% after 500 cycles at 1C rate, and the best rate capability with the discharge capacity of 119 mAh/g at 10C rate, which is about 93.7% of its capacity at 0.5C
- The thermal properties of the spinels have been tested by C80 calorimeter and the results show that introduction of Al in LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 can effectively suppress the exothermic reaction below 225 °C, thus improve the safety of the high voltage cathode material.
