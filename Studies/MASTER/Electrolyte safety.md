# Electrolyte safety
- Thermal stability of solvents w/LiPF$_6$: DMC>EMC>EC>DEC
- DEC found to be particularly unstable, with the most flammable products.

- Typical stability window of organic electrolytes: 
	- $E_g \approx 3V$
	- HOMO $4.3V$ below Li ref electrode. 
		- Meaning Graphite anode is outside stability window(higher $\mu_A$ than LUMO of e-lyte)
		- Degrades e-lyte on anode. Mitigated by SEI.

When pure electrolyte:
- EMC and DMC only evaporates, no combustion upto 400$^\circ C$
- DEC and EC starts decomposing at 300$\^circ$C and 180$^\circ$C

When 1.2M LiPF$_6$:
- DMC only evaporates, no combustion upto 400$^\circ C$
- EMC has small decomp at 180$^\circ$C
- DEC and EC starts decomposing at 1600$\^circ$C and 200$^\circ$C

DEC:
- Produces the lowest amount of CO$_2$, and the highest amount of H$_2$, ethane and propane.
DMC:
- Highest CO$_2$ production: Lowest flammable gas production.
