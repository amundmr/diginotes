# Transient Voltammetry


## (Linear) scan, Sweep, Ramp of voltage

$E(t) = E_0 \pm vt$

## Linear - Scan voltammetry
- Plot of current vs time

## Cyclic voltammetry

- Cycles back to starting point
- Reversal time
- Reversal potential, switching potential
- Plot of current vs potential

Contains info on:
- Number if steps (peaks)
- Character and reversibility (shape)
- Kinetics and transport (shape, offset)
- Charge (Integral of peaks)

## Ultimate cyclic voltammetry

- Repeats the cycling until pattern becomes the same

### Reversible:

Kinetics is fast, diffusion is slow, transport is slow. Transport limited


### Irreversible:

Kinetics limits, diffusion is fast


### Quasi-reversible:

Both limits somewhat


## Semiintegration

Semiintegration is skipped in this course.


## Multiple electron transfers

$Ni = Ni^{2+} + 2e^-$

$ 2H_2O = O_2 + 4e^- + 4H^+$
