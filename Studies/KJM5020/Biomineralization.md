More info in [[Biomaterials]].
- Biomineralization; When a biological creature makes a mineral.
- Bio-minerals = biogenic minerals
- Biomimetic materials: when we mimic biomineralaized materials

# Substances
- Carbonates, Phosphates, Sulfates
- Cations can be Calcium, Magnesium, Iron, Silicon
- CaCO3 in shell, CaPO4 in bones, FeO in magnets

# Two fundamentl processes of bio-mineralization

## Biologically induced mineralization:
- Segregation of constituent to react with species in environment.
- No control of type of bio-mineral formed

## Biologically controlled mineralization:
- Organisms use cellular activities to direct nucleation, growth, morphology and final location of the mineral that is deposited.
