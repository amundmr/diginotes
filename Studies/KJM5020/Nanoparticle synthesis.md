# Hot injection, and heat-up
**Hot injection:**
- one reagent added quickly to boost supersaturation

**Heat-up:**
- All reactants added together, then heated. Supersaturation reached during this heating.
- Can only hope for this to happen fast enough to have homogeneous and small particles.

## LaMer Theory
[[Precipitation#LaMer model]]
- Can explain nucleation and growth of NP's in the abovementioned synthesis routes.

**Secondary mechanisms after nucleation**
- Coalescence: Particles are fused together to one blob where the original particles are not distinguishable.
- Agglomeration: Particles fused together are still distinguishable.
- Oriented attachment: Particles are fused together is special orientations.

# Cobalt NP synthesis
- Made by burst nucleation (hot injection)
	- Solvent, surfactant(oleic acid), cobalt precursor, (usually a reduction agent but not for cobalt since its already in ox state 0)
	- Cobolt carbonyl decomposes at 50C, so when hot injected it immediately decomposes, and nucleates. Then the surfactants in the hotsoup protect the particles from more growth and coalesence.

# Micelles, Inverse Micelles, Vesicles

These micelle cavities can be called nanoreactors.
- Size can be tuned by amount of the two liquids (polar/not polar) and the surfactant
How are vesicles made? Almost philosophical question, because it might be the start of life as we know it.
