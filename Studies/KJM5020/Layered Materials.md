# Graphite, LDHs, RP-Oxides
- Graphite: 
- LDH: Between the layers: Nitrate, H$_2$O anionic between the cationic layers, much stronger interlayer bonds(hydrogen bonds) than graphite.
- RP: Ruddlesen-popper. Extremely high interlayer bonds, polarcovalent.

# Delamination, exfoliation and reconstruction
- **Delamination:** Remove them somewhat from each other
- **Exfoliation:** Completely remove the layers from each other
- **Reconstruction:** The reverse process of the aforementioned: restacking layers
- Graphite easy to delaminate, LDH harder and RP phases hard to delaminate.

## How to facilitate exfoliation chemically and mechanically
- Delamination:
	- Weaken interlayer forces:
		- External force (shear; ultrasonication)
		- Soft chemistry: Solvents. Formamide easily delaminates nitrate LDH.
		- Stabilize nanoflakes in suspension: Good solvent needed, "likt lÃ¸ser likt"

# Brief atomc arrangement in graphite, h-BN and h-MoS$_2$
- h-BN has equal crystal structure to Graphite ![[h-Bn_and_MoS2.png]]
- All three can be exfoliated.
	- Graphene: conducting properties, strong
	- Songle Layer Boron Nitride: Coatings, dielectric
	- MoS$_2$: Lube(as bulk), quantum dots(since it is semiconductor)

# Layered Double Hydroxide (LDH)
- Crystal structure: As Brucite - Mg(OH)$_2$. Spacegroup: P3m1 ![[LDH.png]]
- Fill anions between the cation hydroxide layers to establish charge neutrality.
- Other cations must have about the same size as magnesium.
- Carbonate anions are most used in nature. Organics like amino acids can also be used.
- Driving force of delamination:
	- Ex: Formamide has equal oxygen to nitrate, which makes it easy to replace nitrate with formamide. The layers are expanded in the Z axis and the delamination is made much easier since the bond strength is lowered.
- Reconstruction can be done by adding sodium carbonates since carbonates is so strongly bonded between brucite layers (also hard to exfoliate LDHs with carbonates)

# 2D nanosheets are good starting point to create nanostructures
- atomic arrangement and chemical composition as the mother 3D materials 
- Can mix with other 2D materials.

# Method to prepare metallic Ni particles on a Mg(Al)O substrate
- Create LDH, manipulate the chemical structure of the LDH
- Ni Al Mg homogenoeusley dispersed in the Brucite layers by wet chemistry synthesis (Can also be made by delamination of two LDH's: one with MgAl and another with NiAl, which can be mixed and restacked by adding sodium carbonate.)
- Heat treat it to remove carbonate and H$_2$O. Then you have MgNi(Al)O, but we need metallic Ni on the MgAlO!
- Heat again (650C) with H$_2$ gas. This reduces the ox state of Nickel, which diffuses to surface and crystallizes as metal blobs.
- Ni-loading can be found by MP-AES(Microwave Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry)
- But Ni(s)/Ni$^{2+}$ can be found by paramagnetic momentum of metallic nickel.(by getting max saturation magnetization of sample.)

# Optical properties in RP-phases
- n = $\infty$ -> only rocksalt phase. RP-1 -> n = 1 -> 0.5 rocksalt layer separates 1 berovskite block.
- 22% power conversion efficiency in the use of RP phase solar cells.
- The higher the n, the higher the wavelength of absorption of light. Higher absorption energy -> smaller quantum dot (really layer thickness)
- When doing monolayer RP phases, all absorption peaks are shifted only slightly to higher energies. Main takeaway: monolayers doesnt really affect it, which proves the quantum dot effect in the above point.

# Optimal platina cluster size for water splitting
- clusters in the size of 10-70 atoms.
- Clusters can be on CdSe particles. Charge transfer between CdSe and Pt cluster.
