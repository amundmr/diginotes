# Close packing of spheres
- Many ionic and metallic structures can be seen as a packing of large ions or atoms with smaller ones placed in the voids in-between.
- Closest packing of spheres can be hexagonal symmetry, ABAB or ABCABC
- **Voids:**
	- hcp and fcc structures
	- Tetrahedral voids
		- In-between 4 large spheres
		- is small
		- 2 per large sphere, T and T'
	- Octahedral voids
		- between 6 large spheres
		- larger
		- 1 per large sphere

- ABAB (hcp) (a)
- ABCABC - turned 45 degrees, (fcc) (b)

- Subsitutent solubility increases with increasing temperature because more flexibility and space available.
- Examples:
	- Rocksalt AX (cations in tetrahedral holes)
	- Fluorite AX$_2$ ()
	- Perovskite ABX$_3$
