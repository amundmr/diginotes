# Kr√∂ger-Vink notation
- Dealing with effective charge: charge relative to what would have been there if the defect wasnt there. Ex: O$^{2-}$ on interstitial, effective charge: 2-
	- O$_i^{//}$
- Symbolics: O is atom, i is what site (here interstitial), / means negative charge.
- Oxygen Vacancy: V$_O^{\cdot \cdot}$, site: vancancy, on oxygen site, with 2+ effective charge.
- ZrO$_2$ Zr vacancy: V$_{Zr}^{////}$ or V$_{Zr}^{4/}$
