# Sol-gel (my slave for LNMO)
You start with a solution, form a gel for heterogeneous dispersion of atomically mixed atoms (hopefully), then decompose gel and sinter -> dream of perfect atomically mixed compounds
- Formation of an oxide netowrk through polycondensation reactions of a molecular precursor in a liquid.
- Sol: stble dispersion of colloidal particles or polymers in a solvent.
- Gel: 3D-continous network
- Prevent problems w/coprecipitation
- Results in smaller particles
- Developed in 1960 due to nuclear industry
- Quick clay
- Shapes: Fibres, powders, xerogel films -> dense ceramic film
- Ex: PZT piezoelectric, stoichi hard to control via ceramic method (and needs 1100$^\circ$C); but w/sol-gel it is easier and only 570-700$^\circ$C needed.

## Theory
### Sol
- Colloidal particles not dissolved, but should not agglomerate or sediment.
- Agglomeration (by Van der Waals) is avoided by:
	- *Electrostatic repulsion:* Charges particle surface and makes them repel. Important for colloidal system.
	- *Steric hindrance:* Particles adsorb a thick layer of organic molecules(SURFACTANTS). Works best in concentrated dispersions. Branched adsorbates works best. Usual for nanomaterials.

### Point of Zero Charge (PZC)
- e$^-$-static repulsion is because: Surface/particle is covered by ionic groups which determines surface potential. Counter ions in solution covers this layer, shielding the rest of the sol from the surface charges.
- For hydroxides, surface potential is determined by pH
- pH where particles is neutral is the PZC
- pH \> PZC -> surface is - charged
- pH \< PZC -> surface is + charged
- 
Compound | PZC(pH)
--- | --- 
MgO | 12
Al$_2$O$_3$ | 9
TiO$_2$ | 6
SnO$_2$ | 4.5
SiO$_2$ | 2.5
- Size of surface potential $\phi_0$ depends on difference between pH and PZC

### Double layer
- Particle moves to electrode with opposite charge and carry adsorbed layer + counter ions
- "slip plane" divides what moves with particle and rest of sol.
	- Slip plane potential = Zeta Potential $\phi_Z$
	- Iso-electrical point (IEP) is which pH makes $\phi_Z$=0
	- Larger $\phi_Z$ = greater stability colloid. (Should be \>30-50mV)
- Given same surface potential, repulsive forces will increase with larger particles.

### Coagulation / Flocculation
- Occur if:
	- $\phi$ is lowered (by pH)
	- Increase # counter ions (decreases thickness of doublelayer)
	- Increase in
- In some cases, it can be re-dispersed:
	- Called Peptizing
	- Removing counter ions (e.g. by washing or adding charged ions(reestablishes double layer))

### Netowork formation (gelation)
- Gel-time: The time it takes to gelate enough to put the container upside down.

**Ostwald ripening:** Can help with creating monodisperse particle sizes
**Ageing:** The gel is still alive and will continue gelation
**Drying:** Maintained structure -> aerogel, collapsed -> Xerogel

## Applications
### Silicates
- Forms gel easily: Not very electropositive and not susceptible to nucleophilic reactions.
- Sol-Gel in some steps:
	- Hydrolysis + condensation of molecules
	- Formation of Sol
	- Gelation(sol-gel transformation)
	- Ageing + Drying

**Hydrolysis + condensation**
- Alkoxides / silanols -> Siloxane groups (Si - O - Si)(with 3 dangling Si bonds)
- Hydrolysis: Si-O-R + H$_2$O -> Si-OH + ROH
- Condensation: Si-OH + Si-OR -> Si-o-Si + ROH

**Slica-gel precursors**

-|Water-glass (Na$_2$SiO$_3$) | Si alkoxide
---|---|---
Dissolved in: | water | organics (alcohol)
Reactive part: | silanol | hyrolysis (OR exchanged for OH)
Gelation starts: | with pH change | Addition of water
 
 *More for alkoxides:*
- It is more complex, but might give more control
-  2 reaction paths:
	- pH\< PZC -> species is positive
	- pH \> PZC -> species is negative
- Acid or base must be used to catalyze reaction

**Condensation parameters:**
- Precursor type
- Water-alkoxide ratio (R$_W$)
- Catalyst type
- Solvent type
- Temp , pH
- Relative + absolute consentration of reactants
- electron density on Si
	- Acid catalyzed demands high electron density
	- Base catalyzed demands low electron density
	- Acid catalyzed -> straight chains
	- Base catalyzed -> Branched networks
- R$_W$ = 1 -> hydrolysis, no condensation

### Metals
- Can create gels
- Often octahedrally coordinated with Oxygen
- Less free than Si tetrahedrons
- Hydrolysis of Ti(OR)$_4$ 10$^5$ faster than Si

### Examples
- Pb(Zr$_{0.48}$,Ti$_{0.52}$)O$_3$
	- Start w/oxides which needs high temp to decompose
	- Need stoichi control + homogeneity
	- Pb is volatile, so it makes it stay.
